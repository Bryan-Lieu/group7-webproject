# **Flow Foods: A Smart Inventory & Waste Reduction System**

This repository will contain all the shared code work for team 7's smart inventory and waste reduction web project/web page that is designed for small restaurants and grocery stores to track as well as manage their inventory stock, as well as have a way to sell or donate near-expiry and overstocked food products/goods, as a means to reduce food waste and insecurity.

The web page was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. All of which contribute to the web page's aesthetics, responsiveness, and interactiveness.
